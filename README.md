# Stock Exchange Symbols

ðŸ“ˆ Fetch and get details of symbols from nasdaq, nyse and amex.

## Usage

### API

The API is exported as a module. You can access it normally using require as:
```
const {build, all, symbol} = require('@lutra-labs/stock-exchange-symbol-info');
```

Note that all the API methods return promises (They are async functions)!

| API  | Parameters Expected | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| build  | -  | Pull data from NASDAQ and store them for later use  |
| all  | -  | Return all the available data as an object of shape: {headers: {...data about the shape of symbol data}, dict: {[symbol: {...data}], ...}}  |
| symbol  | symbol - ticker symbol to get data for  | Returns data for the particular symbol  |

At the time of publishing, the headers look like:
```json
{
    "symbol":"Symbol",
    "name":"Name",
    "lastsale":"Last Sale",
    "netchange":"Net Change",
    "pctchange":"% Change",
    "marketCap":"Market Cap",
    "country":"Country",
    "ipoyear":"IPO Year",
    "volume":"Volume",
    "sector":"Sector",
    "industry":"Industry",
    "url":"Url"
}
```
